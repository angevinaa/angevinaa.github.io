I have experience designing, launching, and successfully managing large, impactful research projects on diverse topics such as Alzheimer's disease, decision-making, opioid addiction, and, most recently, breast cancer tumor biomarkers. I am passionate about data; I love working with challenging datasets and turning complex ideas and impossible projects into reality.
